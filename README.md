Print the array of names using an enhanced for loop.

2) Replace the enhanced for loop in part 1 by a standard for loop to print the customer names.3) Create a second double array called customerBalance in the main method. Allow room for five customer balances, each stored as a double. Add a loop that prompts the user with each customer name in order to enter a balance for that customer. Read the keyboard input with a Scanner object. Use the following balances for the input:

100.00234.562.4932.32400.00

After all the balances have been entered, print out each customer and his/her balance.
